## Vulnerability Report  

##### Vulnerability 1  
###### Administration Access  
If the administration route were found, this would've given users access as an administrator. Meaning, the user would have the ability to edit, delete, and add to our inventory. Which could've been detrimental to our site.  

This would have allowed the user to display information and products that are not correct or available to our other users.  

###### Repair  
To fix this issue the team had made the adminstration route "Authorized" with the "Admin Only" policy. Meaning, only those authrozed were allowed access. We then created an email claim to verify whether or not the registered user is an adminstrator. Based off the email registered with, if it did not match the email we had created for the administrators, then the user was denied access. Otherwise, the user was given access.  

            Making the admin route authorized:
            [Authorize(Policy = "Admin Only")]
            
            Policy:
            options.AddPolicy("Admin Only", policy => policy.RequireRole(ApplicationRoles.Admin)));

            Email Claim:
            Claim email = new Claim(ClaimTypes.Email, user.Email, ClaimValueTypes.Email);  


##### Vulnerability 2  
###### Passwords    
If our application were hacked and a hacker were to see all of our registered user's information, we would be in some hot water for not protecting our user's credentials. The hacker can even use those passwords to try and log into other sites that our users are registered with.   

The hacker can use those passwords to get even more sensetive information which could be extremely harmful to our users.  

###### Repair  
To resolve this issue the team had used the Identity framework, the Identity framework calls HashPashword() to hash the provided password, before storing it in the database. When a user logs in, the framework calls VerifyHashedPassword() with the user's account, the stored password hash, and the password provided by the user.  


##### Vulnerability 3  
###### User Information    
We want to store relevant information regarding our users in our database. By doing this we are able to access our user's account quickly and efficiently. If we don't have all the necessary information from our users, it will be extremely difficult to locate our user's account and make any changes if needed.   


###### Repair  
To fix this issue our team decided to add data notations to all the information that we needed from our users at the time of registration. By doing this, it would be required for all registered users to input all the necessary information our application needs.   
           
        Example: 
        [Required]
        [Display(Name = "First Name")]
